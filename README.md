- This device helps the customers place their orders by scanning a QR code in  dine-in restaurants within seconds from their smartphones.
- This helps restaurants to reguarly update their menu cards and higlight trending and most popular dishes with a hassle free process. 
- The restaurants need not print menu cards again even if they need to add/remove/update dish details like price, ingredients ect.
- This also helps restaurant owners to reduce the man power & its associated cost. 
- This results in speeding up the serving time of dine-in restaurants by automating the process in which a waiter takes the customerâ€™s order, now the customers don't have to wait neither for the waiter to come and take their orders nor for him to bring bills for payment.
