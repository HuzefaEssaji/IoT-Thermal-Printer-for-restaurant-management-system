- This device helps the customers place their orders by scanning a QR code in  dine-in restaurants within seconds from their smartphones.
- This helps restaurants to reguarly update their menu cards and higlight trending and most popular dishes with a hassle free process. 
- The restaurants need not print menu cards again even if they need to add/remove/update dishe details like Price, ingridients ect.
- This also helps restaurant owners to hire fewer waiters and reduce staff’s salary costs. 
- This results in speeding up the serving time of dine-in restaurants by automating the process in which a waiter takes  the customer’s order. The customers don't have to  wait for the waiter to take their orders or wait for them to bring bills for payment.
